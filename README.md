Sudoku puzzles can be efficiently solved using algorithms, making it an ideal task for computers. In this research paper, we explore
the development and evaluation of a Sudoku problem solver that leverages deep learning andcomputer vision techniques. The system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset to detect handwritten digits within the Sudoku grid. By combining the power of machine learning and logical reasoning, our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of pattern identification and algorithmic problem solving. Once the digits are recognized, the solver utilizes the backtracking algorithm to systematically fill in the missing numbers and solve the Sudoku puzzle.
